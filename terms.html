                    <h3>GRUB CRAWL STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
                    <p>
                        These GRUB CRAWL Standard Terms & Conditions are entered into by and between GRUB CRAWL LLC, (“GRUB CRAWL”), a California Limited Liability Company, and you (and GRUB CRAWL, on whose behalf you are accepting this Agreement) (“Merchant”). This Agreement governs Merchant’s relationship with GRUB CRAWL and Merchant’s use of the GRUB CRAWL Partner Portal (“Platform”). Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing the Platform, because by accessing the Platform, clicking the below checkbox, or otherwise manifesting assent to this Agreement, Merchant agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Merchant does not agree to (or cannot comply with) all of the terms of this Agreement, then do not access or use the Platform. The parties hereby agree as follows:
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>1. PURCHASE OF MERCHANT SERVICE</h3>
                    <p>
                        1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, GRUB CRAWL will feature one (1) or more specific services available from Merchant (each, a “Service”) on the GrubCrawl.com website (the “Site”), and allow GRUB CRAWL users (“Users”) to purchase such Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1.2 GRUB CRAWL will display on the Site the Merchant Service(s) that have been approved by GRUB CRAWL through Merchant’s completion of the information requested on this Platform, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference (such completion and approval, “Registration”). All information to be displayed on the Site must be approved by GRUB CRAWL prior to such display. At all times during the term of this Agreement, Merchant must make all Services available to GRUB CRAWL that it makes available to any other online distributor or travel-related distributor or any other third party, except as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1.3 Merchant will provide GRUB CRAWL with (a) content, photos, and information regarding each Service as detailed and requested on or through the Platform in a timely manner and (b) reasonably requested assistance and cooperation in the display and sale of the Service (which may include, without limitation, actively managing the information and inventory on GRUB CRAWL’s Platform). If Merchant wishes to alter the features of any Service, it must provide GRUB CRAWL five (5) business days prior written notice in advance of the desired effective date of such change; no change will become effective without GRUB CRAWL’s approval. Changes to a Service’s features will not apply retroactively to Vouchers (defined below) already purchased by Users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1.4 GRUB CRAWL will offer the Services to Users on the Site, as described herein, at a price to be set by the Merchant (“Listing Price”) - through the Platform, Registration, or otherwise - must be the no more than fifteen percent (15%) higher than the lowest price at which each Service is sold by Merchant or any third party to any end user of that Service (the “Lowest Public Price”). Merchant will immediately notify GRUB CRAWL in writing upon becoming aware of any changes in the Lowest Public Price. Merchant will offer each Service to GRUB CRAWL on the best terms (including the best Margin, defined below) it offers such Service to any third party (including, without limitation, any resellers or customers). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merchant may, on an infrequent basis, allow consumers to purchase Services from third-party daily deal sites ("Promotional Deal Services") including, without limitation, LivingSocial, Groupon, Bloomspot and Jetsetter, using time-limited promotional vouchers (a “Promotional Voucher”). GRUB CRAWL requests that Merchant provide GRUB CRAWL with the courtesy of advance notice of Merchant’s participation in Promotional Deal Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1.5 GRUB CRAWL will collect payment from Users who purchase Services, and will inform Merchant in a timely manner that a Service has been booked. GRUB CRAWL will provide each purchasing User proof of payment (a “Voucher”) and directions on how to use a Voucher for the purchased Service. A Voucher is a ticket to a one-time event, that can only be used on the date(s) indicated at the time of purchase of the Voucher (such date, or the last of such dates if the Voucher is valid for more than one date, the “Validity Date”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1.6 GRUB CRAWL may also promote the Merchant Service using other means, such as email marketing and displaying content on third-party websites and/or on GRUB CRAWL’s application(s), in a manner to be decided by GRUB CRAWL. The manner and method by which the Service is displayed on the Site and other venues, and to what extent and duration, shall also be decided by GRUB CRAWL.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>2. USE OF MERCHANT SERVICE</h3>
                    <p>
                        2.1 Upon presentation of the applicable Voucher by User, Merchant will perform all Services, in accordance with the terms agreed to by the parties in writing, during Registration or otherwise through the Platform. Merchant will maintain a sufficient level of inventory, site availability, and staffing to perform all Services purchased through the Site. If a Service is not available when User attempts to use a Voucher for such Service, Merchant will offer User a service of equal or greater value (the “Alternative Service”). If User refuses the Alternative Service, GRUB CRAWL reserves the right to grant such User a refund, and in such event no amount will be due to Merchant with respect to such User’s purchase of the applicable Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.2 If Merchant needs to discontinue the performance of a Service, it will inform GRUB CRAWL immediately, and in no event less than thirty (30) days prior to the cessation of the applicable Service (“Cessation Date”). The foregoing shall not relieve Merchant from the obligation to perform any Services applicable to a Voucher that has already been purchased by a User prior to such Cessation Date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.3 Merchant will not charge User any taxes or fees of any kind whatsoever when User uses a Voucher.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.4 Merchant will provide suitable instruction to Merchant employees on how to properly accept a Voucher, and will keep accurate records of each Voucher accepted. Merchant must ensure Users present a valid ID before accepting the Voucher. Merchant shall accept each Voucher only once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.5 In no event will GRUB CRAWL be responsible for the payment, collection or billing of any incidentals, gratuities or additional charges incurred by Users. Merchant, and not GRUB CRAWL, shall be solely responsible for any claims, losses, or costs suffered by a User in connection with use of a Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.6 GRUB CRAWL asks Users to arrive 10 minutes early. Merchant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate Users arriving after any cut-off time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.7 GRUB CRAWL provides customer support to Users. In the case that Users contact Merchant directly, Merchant will make available to all Users customer support representatives. Merchant’s customer support representatives should be trained to discuss GRUB CRAWL-related inquiries and respond to requests for support. Merchant will provide an equal level of support to GRUB CRAWL Users as to Merchant’s other customers.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>3. PRIVATE REQUESTS</h3>
                    <p>
                        When a User requests GRUB CRAWL for private services, GRUB CRAWL shall conduct the following procedures:
                        GRUB CRAWL shall obtain the User’s requested geographic region, scope of services, schedule, and budget information (“Private Request”).
                        GRUB CRAWL shall identify Merchants that can potentially accommodate the Private Request and distribute a Request for Proposals to these Merchants.
                        The interested Merchants shall submit proposals to GRUB CRAWL that align to the Private Request and provide a Listing Price.
                        GRUB CRAWL will present the proposals to the User and request a $50 nonrefundable payment to GRUB CRAWL for a “Reservation Fee”.
                        The User may select and reserve one of the Merchant proposals, by submitting payment for the “Reservation Fee”.
                        GRUB CRAWL will notify the Merchant of the proposal reservation and request payment for the Listing Price from the User.
                        The User may confirm the proposal, by submitting the full payment of the Listing Price to GRUB CRAWL.
                        GRUB CRAWL will notify both the User and the Merchant of the awarded Private Request proposal, and the Merchant shall provide services subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement and as defined in the Private Request proposal.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>4. PRICING STRUCTURE; TAXES & FEES</h3>
                    <p>
                        4.1 GRUB CRAWL’s commission shall be defined as the "Margin" and shall vary as follows:

                        Services: fifteen percent (15%) of Listing Price
                        Private Request: twenty percent (20%) of Listing Price
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.2 Merchant Payment is equal to the Listing Price, as defined in Section 1.4, actually received by GRUB CRAWL from the purchasing User, less Margin percentage (“Merchant Payment”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.3 Credit processing fees shall be 2.9% of Listing Price, plus $0.30 cents. Credit processing fees shall be paid by the purchasing User.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.4 Merchant shall bear and be responsible for any applicable federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, levies, withholdings and similar assessments (including without limitation, sales taxes, use taxes, value added taxes and any applicable governmental fees) relating to the subject matter hereunder, excluding taxes based upon GRUB CRAWL’s net income.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.5 Merchant acknowledges and agrees that Merchant, not GRUB CRAWL, is the seller of record of Services, and GRUB CRAWL’s activities hereunder are undertaken solely to assist Merchant in facilitating the sale of such Services.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. PAYMENT TO MERCHANT</h3>
                    <p>
                        5.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, within ten (10) calendar days after an event ends (“Payment Period”), GRUB CRAWL will remit to Merchant the Merchant Payment actually received by GRUB CRAWL for each Voucher (a) which was redeemed during such Payment Period or (b) for which the Validity Date occurred during the Payment Period but which was never redeemed by a User (for example, a “no-show”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5.2 GRUB CRAWL is entitled to set off any refunds it has given to Users for Merchant Services against any amounts due to Merchant hereunder. All payments will be made in U.S. Dollars. GRUB CRAWL reserves the right to request additional information about unredeemed Vouchers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5.3 Notwithstanding any provision herein, GRUB CRAWL reserves the right to withhold any payment to Merchant if the total amount owed to Merchant is less than fifty USD ($50) (the “Minimum Threshold”). If amounts payable to Merchant in a given Payment Period do not meet the Minimum Threshold, such amounts will be paid to Merchant along with the next payment.
                    </p>

                    <h3>6. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each party shall comply with all applicable laws with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Merchant’s obligations under this Section 5 shall include, without limitation, compliance with laws prohibiting Merchant from providing alcohol or tobacco products to those under the legal age to purchase or consume such items. If Merchant refuses to accept a Voucher because it believes it is unlawful to so accept the Voucher, Merchant will notify GRUB CRAWL immediately in writing of the basis of same and GRUB CRAWL shall be relieved of any obligation to pay Merchant for the Services represented by the Voucher.
                    </p>

                    <h3>7. TERM AND TERMINATION</h3>
                    <p>
                        7.1 This Agreement will be in effect from the date executed by Merchant and continue until terminated by either party in writing, in accordance with the provisions of this Section.

                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7.3 If termination (of the Agreement or with respect to a particular Service) occurs before the Validity Date for any Voucher purchased but not yet used, Merchant must continue to accept all such Vouchers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement until the applicable Validity Date.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by Merchant except with GRUB CRAWL’s prior written consent.

(“JAMS”), by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.
